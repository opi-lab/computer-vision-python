# Computer Vision in Python

### First semester 2018

Andrés Marrugo, PhD 
*Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar*

##  Aims and Scope

This semester course is an introduction to computer vision in Python. It is aimed at graduate students in the Faculty of Engineering. We will focus on the practical aspects of techniques in computer vision with a hands on approach.

At the end of the lectures, one would be able to:

- Understand many different computer vision algorithms and approaches.
- Implement computer vision algorithms for mid-level vision tasks in Python.
